# Word Match

The interface allows a user to select matching labels that depict the same number in textual and numeric form.
Multiple textual and numeric representations can not be selected at the same time.
Uppon successful completion of the task the application displays a congratulations message.

### Getting starting:

1. Clone it: git clone git@github.com:shawki2/Word-Match.git
2. Install `npm i` or `npm install`
3. Locally, run `npm start` from `top level` folder to have hot reload.

### Approch:

In this task, the user interface is specified and built using ReactJS. Textual/Numeric label matching is checked via two additional functions that embed this behaviour.

## Main Framework and Libraries:

- HTML
- CSS
- ES6
- JavaScript
- React

## Future improvements

I'd like to keep expanding this project to hone my existing skills, as well as to explore new technologies. Improve UI for better user experience and the users can able to change the word if they would like before choosing a number.
